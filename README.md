Keywords: Computational Chemistry, Theoretical Chemistry, Many Body Interactions, Electronic Structure

## Many Body Decomposition Background
The total binding energy of an N-molecule system can be decomposed in contributions of one-body (1B), two-body (2B), ... , N-body (NB). In [this paper](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4742816) they present, in Equation 7, a recursive formula used to calculate the many body interactions. This expression is the one used in this package.
